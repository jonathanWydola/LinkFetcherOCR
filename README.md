Fetches links of of your phones camera


Jonathan Wydola



This app will open to the main activity, user will be prompted with 2 selections, to scan image using camera or to scan image using a picture from the gallery. The picture will then be rendered by the goolge vision api to pull a url from the picture. This url will then be stored in a database that will keep previously searched items. A match on previously searched items will act as a cache to quickly open url’s that are contained already in the database. The title will be pulled from the html page and will display the title in place of the url.
