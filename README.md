This app will open to the main activity, user will be prompted with 2 selections, to scan image using camera or to scan image using a picture from the gallery. The picture will then be rendered by the goolge vision api to pull a url from the picture. This url will then be stored in a database that will keep previously searched items. A match on previously searched items will act as a cache to quickly open urlâ€™s that are contained already in the database. The title will be pulled from the html page and will display the title in place of the url.
